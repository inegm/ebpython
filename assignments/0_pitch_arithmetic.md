# Pitch arithmetic

1- Calculate the MIDI note value of pitches labeled in Herz. You can refer to the wikipedia page for Pitch: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)#Labeling_pitches> for the formula.

2- Calculate the pitch value in Hertz of a MIDI note.

3- Create random twelve-tone rows (see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(music)>) represented as integer interval values using one of Python's list built-in functions. You will need to use the [random](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/random.html) module.

4- **BONUS** Create twelve-tone rows represented as MIDI notes, with the root note chosen at random.
