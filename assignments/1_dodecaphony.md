Use the following document : [Twelve-Tone Technique: A Quick Reference](http://musike.cmpr.edu/docs/v001/roman-eng.pdf) to help you write the following functions:

- `def transpose_row(row, semitones)`
- `def generate_tone_row(root=0)`
- `def retrograde_tone_row(row)`
- `def invert_tone_row(row)`

Note that the `invert_tone_row` function is quite challenging. You might need to use exception handling.

Also, remember [.copy()](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/copy.html).

**Bonus** There is a mistake in the document linked above. Don't worry, it shouldn't stop you from finding the correct answers. Be confident in your results and point out the mistake for bonus points.
