# ebpython
EasternBloc Python fundamentals course

## Setup

Check that you have python installed by opening up a console and typing `python` at the prompt. You should see something like this:

  Python 3.5.3 (default, Nov 23 2017, 11:34:05)
  [GCC 6.3.0 20170406] on linux
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>>

If you do, you're in a Python console! Notice your version number on the first line of the output (mine is 3.5.3). For now, exit the console.

    Use exit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit
